What documents should I have received with my Soekris box?

Your invoiceÂ :)

But seriously, manuals for net4501 and net4801 are available on the [Soekris website](https://web.archive.org/web/20180610231755/http://www.soekris.com/downloads.htm "http://www.soekris.com/downloads.htm"), and other information can be found on the soekris website (or here). The undocumented models are mostly similar to others, until official documentation is produced, please see the [Unofficial Hardware Manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20180610231755/http://wiki.soekris.info/Unofficial_Hardware_Manual "Unofficial Hardware Manual").
