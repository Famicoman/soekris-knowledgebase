Single PC-Card/CardBus 100 Mhz 486 based mainboard for wireless applications

## Soekris Engineering net4511

This compact, low-power, low-cost, advanced communication computer is based on a 100 or 133 Mhz 486 class processor. It has two 10/100 Mbit ethernet ports, up to 64 Mbyte SDRAM main memory and uses a CompactFlash module for program and data storage. It can be expanded using a MiniPCI type III board and a PC-Card/Cardbus adapter. 

It has been optimized for use as wireless router using a PC-Card wireless adapter, but has the flexibility to take on a whole range of different functions as a communication appliance. The board is designed for long life and low power.

It will be available in any volume in the standard version, and as board only or with a small metal box and various power supplies. The board can be customized according to requirements when ordering higher volume.

Please note that the available standard case has cutouts for two RP-TNC Jacks for the external antennas, but does not include the connectors and cables. Also, the standard transformer available from soekris is a regular wall mount type, it is not a PoE type.
