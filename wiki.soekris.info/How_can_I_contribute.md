**How can I contribute?**


Well, all you need is to have a registered account on the wiki. To get that click the top right corner and fill out the user form.


All accounts need to be approved, but we usually approve several times a day. Pretty much everyone is accepted, this is just a anti-spam measure.


If you have any issues with the registration process, just write on Soekris mailinglist or to **wiki at cortexsystems.dk**
