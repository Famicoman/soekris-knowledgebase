# How is a Soekris box managed?

The Soekris box is managed over a [serial link](Serial_port.md "Serial port") using another computer's COM port.

Soekris box and computer are connected using a null-modem cable.
Management is done from within a serial console on the other computer. Many models
have one or more extra Ethernet ports for use as management interface after the OS
has been installed.
