Midrange communication mainboard, with a 233 or 266 Mhz Geode SC1100 processor



#  Soekris Engineering net4801


This compact, low-power, low-cost, advanced communication computer is based on an up to 266 Mhz 586 class processor. It has three 10/100 Mbit ethernet ports, up to 256 Mbyte SDRAM main memory and uses a CompactFlash module for program and data storage. It can be expanded using a MiniPCI type III board and a low-power standard PCI board.


It has been optimized for use as a Firewall, VPN Router and Internet Gateway, but has the flexibility to take on a whole range of different functions as a communication appliance. The board is designed for long life and low power.


It will be available in any volume in the standard version, and as board only or with a small metal box and various power supplies. The board can be customized according to requirements when ordering higher volume.
