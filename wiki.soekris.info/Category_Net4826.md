Dual Mini-PCI 266 Mhz Geode SC1100 based mainboard for wireless applications



#  Soekris Engineering net4826


This compact, low-power, low-cost, advanced communication computer is based on a 233 or 266 Mhz 586 class processor. It has one 10/100 Mbit ethernet ports, up to 256 Mbyte SDRAM main memory and uses a CompactFlash circuit soldered onboard for program and data storage. It can be expanded using up to two MiniPCI type III boards.


It has been optimized for use as wireless router using Mini-PCI wireless boards, but has the flexibility to take on a whole range of different functions as a communication appliance. The board is designed for long life, low power and extended temperature range.


**Please note that this product has reached end of life status.**


The net4826-40 and net4826-48 are still available in small volume, as board only or with a small metal box and various power supplies.


Please note that the available standard case has cutouts for two RP-TNC Jacks for the external antennas, but does not include the connectors and cables.
