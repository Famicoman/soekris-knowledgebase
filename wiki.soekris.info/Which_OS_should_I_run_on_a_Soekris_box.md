# Which OS should I run on a Soekris box?

That entirely depends on your needs, and what OS you're familiar with. Amongst those
that have proven to perform well, and have been extensively documented, are FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, Debian GNU/Linux and Gentoo Linux. In general you'll want a customizable,
lightweight system, without all the [proto-]graphical stuff, which will save your memory for
your data. But in the end it's up to you.
