**What do the digits in "netXXXX" stand for?**


[Not entirely sure about this one..]


The first two digits refer to the type of Soekris board, or family if you
like. The last two digits apply to the board's configuration. A "01" refers to
the base configuration, which is also the one the User Manual applies to
directly. Other values indicate that the same base configuration is used,
but with extended interfaces. The last digits so far has been "11" and "12"
for single and dual cardbus configurations and "26" for dual mini-PCI boards.
