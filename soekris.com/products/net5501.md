# net5501 Product Range

This compact, low-power, low-cost, advanced communication computer is based on an up to 500 Mhz 586 class processor. It has four 10/100 Mbit ethernet ports, up to 512 Mbyte DDR-SDRAM main memory and uses a CompactFlash module for program and data storage. It can be expanded using a MiniPCI type III board, a hard drive and one or two low-power standard PCI board.

It has been optimized for use as a Firewall, VPN Router, Internet Gateway and VoIP PBX, but has the flexibility to take on a whole range of different functions as a communication appliance. The board is designed for long life and low power.

It is available in any volume in the standard version, and as board only or with a small metal box (11.38"W x 6.75"D x 1.29"H) and various power supplies, or a 1U 19" rackmount case (17"W x 6.75"D x 1.69"H) with internal power supply included. The board can be customized according to requirements when ordering higher volume. With an HDD mounting kit you can install a 2.5" HDD on top of the board.
