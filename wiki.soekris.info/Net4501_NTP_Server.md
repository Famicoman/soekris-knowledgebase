The net4501 is an excellent low-power / high-reliability device to use as a Stratum 1 NTP server. The great thing about the net4501 is that the Elan SC520 CPU has internal time registers with a resolution of about ~125 nanoseconds (according to others) and can be accessed with a few simple hardware modifications and proper kernel settings in FreeBSD. However, to fully benefit from this level of precision would require replacing the stock clock crystal with a signal from a more stable source.
