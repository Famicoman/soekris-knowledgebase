**What is a Soekris box?**


A Soekris box is basically an x86 compatible single-board computer in an STB format. Although separate mainboards are available, it is mostly shipped in a nice-looking mint-green case about the size of a cigar box. Which x86 class it is compatible with depends on the model. The recents boards come with AMD Geode CPUs.
