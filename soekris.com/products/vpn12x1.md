# vpn1201 and vpn1211

These two small hardware security accelerators deliver excellent performance at a value price, off loading the CPU of the computing intensive tasks of encryption and compression. They are perfect for low cost and low power VPN Routers like the net4501, and can deliver at throughput of up to 64 Mbps doing encryption and compression, more than enough for use at T1, E1, DSL and Ethernet speeds.

They are available in two versions with the same functionality and performance, one for the standard PCI bus, and one for the Mini-PCI type III form factor, perfect for use in the net4501.
