**Is there a list of supported and unsupported hardware?**


No, but if you read the User Manual and Specifications carefully, you should
be able to figure out whether the device you are planning to is is fit for a
Soekris box. In addition you can search the soekris-tech list. If in doubt,
feel free to consult the soekris-tech list.
