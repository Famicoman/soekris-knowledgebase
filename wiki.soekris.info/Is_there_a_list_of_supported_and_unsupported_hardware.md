# Is there a list of supported and unsupported hardware?

No, but if you read the User Manual and Specifications carefully, you should
be able to figure out whether the device you are planning to is is fit for a
Soekris box. In addition you can search the soekris-tech list. If in doubt,
feel free to consult the soekris-tech list.
