faster mid-range communications mainboard, with a 600MHz to 1.6GHz Atom



#  Soekris Engineering net6501


This compact, low-power, low-cost, advanced communication computer is based on an up to 1.6 Ghz Intel Atom E6xx series processor. It has four 10/100/1000 Mbit ethernet ports, up to 2 Gbyte DDR2-SDRAM main memory and uses a uSD or mSATA module for program and data storage. It can be expanded using MiniPCI-Express boards, hard drives and low-power standard PCI-Express boards.


It has been optimized for use as a Firewall, VPN Router, Internet Gateway and Small Server Applications, but has the flexibility to take on a whole range of different functions as a communication appliance. The board is designed for long life and low power.


It is available in any volume in the standard version, and as board only or with a small metal box and various power supplies. The board can be customized according to requirements when ordering higher volume.
